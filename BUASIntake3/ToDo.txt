TO DO

Make the player attack:
	-Player should do attack anim before moving on the next grid
	-Enemy should play dead anim and be removed
	-This takes a turn of the player
	*Adjust the progress in Level.cpp updateCollision(). Make sure to just
	make variables of each line of the player collider and make logic 
	work from there

-> Add pause to menu to quit or restart
-> Add restart while playing:
	-Make the level restart when player presses R
	-Display text underneath the level to restart with R

**If evertyhing is implemented
